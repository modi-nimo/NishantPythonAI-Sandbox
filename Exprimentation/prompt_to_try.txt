A 3D cartoon-style action figure of a man named Nishant Modi is displayed inside a clear plastic blister package like a collectible toy. The figure resembles an Asian male with blackish hair combed forward. He wears a lime green polo with the Globant logo in the upper left of the polo, black fitted pants, and black dress shoes. He has a smart watch on his left hand.

The packaging has a clean, modern, cartoonish design. The top of the packaging is bright blue, with bold white text that reads: 'Nishant Modi' as the name, and below it, in smaller text: 'GenAI-Python Technical Lead'.

Inside the blister package, next to the figure, are miniature job-related accessories: a navy blue OnePlus phone, black Bose over-ear headphones, a McD's Burger Meal with Fries and Coke, and a silver Mac Pro laptop.

The overall look is colorful, professional, and playful â€” like a limited-edition tech professional collectible figure sold in stores.
